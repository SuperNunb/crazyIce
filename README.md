A small little videogame I'm working on, using python and pygame. 

INSTALLATION: 
This game should work on any regular Windows computer. 

Method 1: 
You can 'clone or download' the game onto your computer. (You'll want the Zip file.) 
Once it's downloaded, you'll probably have to extract it to your computer, into its own folder. 
Open the 'main.exe' file; hopefully your antivirus software doesn't take too long to scan it!
Sorry for it being so complicated to install; I've tried to make it as streamlined as possible. 

Method 2: 
I've tried to make an installer for the game if you want, although it might not work perfectly:
